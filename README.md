## 👁️ What Is a FragPunk Wallhack?

A **Wallhack** (or ESP – Extra Sensory Perception) for FragPunk overlays data like player positions, health, weapons, and more directly onto your screen — even through solid walls, smoke, or terrain.

You’ll always know:

* Where enemies are hiding
* What gun they’re holding
* If they’re weak or full HP
* When to push, rotate, or flank

It’s next-level map control. 🧠
